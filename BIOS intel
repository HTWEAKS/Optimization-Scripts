Intel Tip: Intel Turbo Boost technology is really trash, if you have an intel K or KF cpu, you are allowed to set clock speeds. If you don’t want to overclock, it's best to set your cpu at your max turbo boost speed statically. So instead of your cpu frequency being within a range, it's at a static number. 


To do this, you set your cpu ratio in bios to the max turbo boost frequency. (EX: The max turbo boost frequency for a 10600k is 4.8ghz, so cpu ratio in bios will be set to 48. You also want to set a static voltage, there are many ways of doing this, but a quick way is to download hwinfo and stress your cpu. Look for the max vcore voltage and just set the cpu voltage in bios to that number or 0.05v-0.15v less. You also want to disable turbo boost and other settings that promote dynamic ranges:


Intel(R) Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 - Disabled
Intel Turbo Boost - Disabled
Voltage Optimization - Disabled
TVB Voltage Optimizations - Disabled
Game Boost - Disabled
